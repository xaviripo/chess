# Chess

By default, the only variation in comparison to normal chess is the fact that the king must be captured, like a normal piece, in order to win.

Each turn the player must:
1. buy from 0 to as many upgrades as they can afford; then
2. move a piece.

Moving a piece does not necessarily result in it ending up in the chosen square. By default, if the square is empty, and the move is legal, then it will
be moved there. When trying to capture an enemy piece, though, the movement will only be completed if the attacking piece has as many attack points as the defending piece has defense points. Otherwise, the defending piece will lose as many defense points as attack points the attacking piece has, but neither piece will move.

## Stats

Each piece has the following stats:

- defense points,
- attack points,
- and effects given by upgrades (which can be temporary or permanent).
